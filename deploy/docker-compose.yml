# docker-compose.yml for MlInference
#
# Start all the services.
# Before running this, secrets need to be created. The easiest thing to do
# is to use './run.sh all' to start all services.
#
# What's here:
#   wasmcloud host
#   local registry
#   nats
#
# Ports open on localhost:
#  - 8080,443 httpserver to mlinference (depending on whether tls is enabled)
#  - 4222,6222,8000 nats
#  - 5000 registry
#
# Data is not saved in volumes, to make it easier to start
#   with a clean image
#

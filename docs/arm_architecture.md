# Build and deploy on Arm devices

This guide specifically addresses [Coral dev board](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/datasheet/) with its __Quad-core Arm Cortex-A53__. However, a deployment on other Arm based devices should be possible in a similar way.

Even though Coral dev board also disposes of an Edge TPU for accelerated inferencing, this guide currently addresses inferencing on the Arm cpu.

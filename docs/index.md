## Machine Learning with wasmCloud

These pages are supposed to document how to set up and deploy machine learning applications based on [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.dev/). 

The current focus narrows any type of machine learning application to the use-case of __*prediction*__ aka __*inferencing*__.

### Structure

* for a general introduction, see [below](#machine-learning-applications)
* configure and deploy on intel architecture
* configure and deploy on [ARM](./arm_architecture.html) (`aarch64`) architecture

### Machine Learning applications

#### Minimal setup

#### Use-cases for pre- and post-processors
